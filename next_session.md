# Next Session - App Store Connect MCP

## Current State: v1.1.1 Production Ready âœ…

RFC-001 is **100% COMPLETE**. The system works and shows correct revenue.

### Quick Status
- **Revenue**: Accurate calculation working (3x improvement)
- **Architecture**: 7 services, 15 MCP tools
- **Data Source**: FINANCIAL reports (complete with renewals)
- **Testing**: 8 retained test utilities

### What Works
```bash
# These commands validate the system:
npx tsx src/test-worldwide-revenue.ts   # Aggregates regions
npx tsx src/test-final-integration.ts   # Shows complete revenue
npx tsx src/test-mcp-server.ts         # 15 tools ready
```

### Key Files
- **RFC Tracker**: `/docs/RFC-001-tracker.md` - Task completion status
- **Learnings**: `/docs/v1.1.1-learnings-summary.md` - Technical discoveries
- **Services**: `/src/services/*` - All 7 domain services

### Known Limitations
- FINANCIAL reports delayed ~1 month (normal)
- Z1 region doesn't work (aggregate US, CA, EU, JP, AU, WW)
- Subscription endpoint returns 400 (use FINANCIAL instead)

### Next Session Focus
If continuing development:
1. **v2.0 Planning**: Write operations support
2. **Optimization**: Response caching layer
3. **Testing**: Add unit tests with Vitest

If debugging issues:
- Check `/docs/v1.1.1-learnings-summary.md` for architecture
- Run test utilities to validate data flow
- FINANCIAL reports are source of truth (not SALES)

### Environment
All credentials in `.env` file. No hardcoded secrets.
